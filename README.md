# First-Python-Project-penalty-analyse

This is my first project in Pyhton. The objective is learning to manipulate data in python langage : the differents packages (pandas, matplotlib), cleaning up the datas, get informations from datas.

I chose to work on a penalty in football file because statistics in sports is the datas i want work with. Plus the penalty statistics is easy to understand so it's better to start with it.

The dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emilerichard/penalty-statistics-20192020

I worked with the notebook Google Collab

First, I splited the work in 3 parts :

I Pressure
  a) Difference between Home and Away pressure 
  b) Champions league pression
  c) Max pressure

II Penalty taker
  a) Players who take and score the most penalties
  b) Club which take the most penalties
  c) The player positions which score the more
  
III Condition
  a) Sub Players percentage
  b) Minutes of penalties obtained
  
To conclude :

The results of the analyses shows that the players take the pressure
The competition which obtain the most number of penalties so far is the Serie A with 8 teams in the Top 10.
And we can see a pic of penatlies's density near the half time.

For a first project, I saw a basic part of the Datas but most important, I enjoyed work in this project and found this very interesting. So I want improve my knowledges about Datas. For example : API, Dashboards, Machine learning.

Finally, I think this project is finished for now because I want to see other aspect of data analyse, but i will definitely keep to work with this project to improve my skills in python and other packages.
